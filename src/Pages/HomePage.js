    <h1>Hello, welcome to my blog!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my blog! 
      I love reading, and I spend many hours with my head on books.
      So, I decided to create this blog to add comments on the books I recently read. Books I enjoyed reading,
      as well as books that are more historic, and others classic novels.

      I believe every book can be accepted by the readers in a different way. Usually, women tend to 
      like books that are more romantic, and platonic. Personally, I enjoy romantic novels like Pride & Prediger  
      but I also enjoy fictional books that are more in the mystery side. 
      Either way, the book must tide me in the first few pages, otherwise I abandonee it soon.
      I like to finish the books, even if they are heavy to read, but it probably takes me more time to finish them.

      Biographies are also some of my favorites.
      I really like to get to know personalities like Elizabeth Taylor, Jackeline Kennedy Onassis.
      One of the Biographies I enjoyed the most was Diana, the Princess of Gales. 
      Of course, as a woman, a princess is like a fantasy story, even when it was real and ended up as tragedy.
      In Biographies you can really get to know the character of the person, usually their flows are remarked as well as their virtues.
      Also, I think reading a biography of a person can create a type of role model, someone you can imitate in your own life. 
      This is not always the case. Elizabeth Taylor's biography really described the struggles she endured.
      The unobtained dreams of her mother who enforced her child to become an actress at a very young age.
      The mutilated childhood, the accident that let Mrs. Taylor forever in pain and made her to become addicted to pain killers. Her struggles with alcohol as well as other drugs and the unfortunate marriages. 
      The constant seeks for happiness that can only come from a high power she was never able to know.
